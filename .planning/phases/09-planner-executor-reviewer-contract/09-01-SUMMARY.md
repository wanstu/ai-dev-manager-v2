# Phase 9 Plan 09-01 Summary

## Delivered

FLOW-01 is implemented as a deterministic workflow kind on the existing persistent Gateway-owned Agent Run lifecycle.

- Added `run_workflow_start`; workflow observation/cancel continues through ordinary `run_list`, `run_status`, and `run_cancel` using stable `run_` identity.
- Planner materializes an explicit immutable goal/ordered step/verifier plan before Run installation, assigns stable `step_01...` IDs, and preflights every executor command through existing Runtime allowlist/cwd authority.
- Executor runs planned commands sequentially on the owner-derived Run context and records per-step timing, state, bounded stdout/stderr, exit code, and structured error evidence.
- Reviewer calls existing `app.Service.RunVerifier` definitions and retains structured verifier results.
- Normal verifier failure is a review rejection, not an orchestration failure: Run lifecycle reaches `succeeded`, review/outcome are `rejected`, and no orchestration error kind is set.
- Executor non-zero and reviewer invocation errors are separately classified as `executor_step_failed` and `reviewer_error` with visible audit state.
- Workflow cancellation reuses Phase 8 writer-gated Run cancellation and owner process-tree cleanup.
- Workflow observations remain owner-local and are absent from `state.json`.

## Scope deliberately not implemented

- no LLM Planner/Executor/Reviewer subagents
- no GSD phase execution or planning-state advancement
- no parallel workflow steps / parallel worktrees
- no automatic Git merge/rebase/push
- no second Run/workflow persistence model or hidden shell authority
