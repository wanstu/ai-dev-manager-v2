# Post-1.0 Phase Map

Date: 2026-09-11
Base: `c898586` (`v1.0.1` green release hotfix)

This document sets the high-level post-1.0 phase sequence. It intentionally does not define execution-level `PLAN.md` files for every phase. Each phase gets a detailed plan only when work on that phase starts.

## Post-1.0 planning rules

1. User-facing management UX is the first priority after the green 1.0 line.
2. Desktop remains a management surface over the shared Core; it must not introduce Desktop-only state, authorization or persistence.
3. CLI remains a management/runtime surface over the same Core; CLI and Desktop can be separated logically before any repository split.
4. ADM supplies capabilities, lifecycle, authorization and diagnostics. It must not become a task planner/orchestrator.
5. Long-running work should prefer async start/status/cancel patterns over blocking request/response calls.
6. Large workspace navigation must be bounded and explainable; ADM should help Agents map human language to likely project roots without scanning arbitrary host paths.
7. Temporary resources must remain explicit, inspectable and conservative to clean up.
8. Distribution polish remains conditional unless daily use proves it is blocking.

## Phase sequence

| Phase | Name | Priority | Status | Purpose |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| 18 | Desktop Management UX Reorganization | P1 | Complete | Make ADM easier for the human operator to manage through a menu-based Desktop shell and validated section workflows. |
| 19 | Workspace Discovery + Project Navigation | P1 | Complete | Let ADM summarize large workspace directories and suggest likely project roots such as `projects/p2`. |
| 20 | Agent Context Bundle + Capability Injection | P1 | Complete | Give Agents a compact explicit Environment context bundle: root, tree digest, enabled MCP/Skill summary, verifier/run guidance and capability reasons, without hidden session selection. |
| 21 | Async Verifier + Long Operation Observability | P1 | Complete | Move heavy verifier/test workflows toward owner-local async observable lifecycle instead of relying on long blocking calls. |
| 22 | Temporary Task Environments + Safe Cleanup Workflow | P1/P2 | COMPLETE | Make task-scoped temporary Environments first-class and safely cleanable/promotable. |
| 23 | CLI Agent UX + MCP/Skill Provisioning | P2 | COMPLETE | Improve CLI flows for MCP/Skill import, enablement, refresh, diagnostics and Agent-friendly setup. |
| 24 | Desktop/CLI Surface Boundary Split | P2/P3 | Planned | Separate Desktop and CLI surfaces logically while preserving one shared Core/state model. |
| 25 | Distribution Polish If Needed | P3 conditional | Standby | Installer, updater, signing, notifications and deeper packaging polish only after concrete dogfood need. |
| 26 | Evidence-first Investigation Expansion | Conditional | Standby | Add deeper code/debug/data evidence helpers only when generic Runtime/search is insufficient. |

## Phase 18 — Desktop Management UX Reorganization

**Goal:** Reorganize Desktop from a dense management panel into a navigable application.

**Scope:** left/top menu shell, dashboard, section routing, clearer current ADM/Gateway status, and first pass at separating Workspace, Environment, Runs, MCP, Skill, Memory, Exec Allowlist, Gateway, Diagnostics and Settings views.

**Non-goals:** new Core model, new persistence, new Desktop-only authorization, installer/updater/signing, major backend expansion.

**Completion direction:** the same management capabilities become easier to find and operate without reducing existing functionality.

**Completion:** Phase 18 is complete. `18-CLOSEOUT.md`, `18-04-SUMMARY.md` and `18-VALIDATION.md` record final browser/full Go/vet/Wails/native evidence, including the D10 artifact-path note.

**Requirements:** ADM-DESKTOP-001, ADM-MGMT-001, ADM-CORE-015/017/020, preserving optional-capability, writer, catalog/Memory and Runtime boundaries. **New prerequisites:** none.

**Delivery sequence:** 18-01 establishes the compact connection/context header, grouped menu, ten real routes, truthful dashboard and shared scope/load-state contract. 18-02 refines Workspace/Environment and existing Runtime views. 18-03 refines MCP/Skill, explicit Global/Environment Memory, existing system controls and diagnostics. 18-04 is mandatory integrated acceptance across final routes/context/focus/scaling and the exact Wails artifact; only evidence-backed regressions are fixed there. Distinguish unloaded from zero, isolate auxiliary read failures, preserve dialogs and discard old-scope responses throughout.

## Phase 19 — Workspace Discovery + Project Navigation

**Goal:** Make large workspace roots understandable when a human says things like “look at p2”.

**Scope:** bounded workspace scan, project candidate summaries, git/module/package markers, suggested Environment root, tree digest and Desktop/CLI/Agent-facing views.

**Non-goals:** arbitrary full-disk indexing, semantic search engine, automatic code editing, hidden background scans.

**Completion direction:** ADM can summarize `projects/p1`, `projects/p2`, `projects/p3` style directories and help select/create the right Environment quickly.

## Phase 20 — Agent Context Bundle + Capability Injection

**Goal:** Reduce Agent setup friction by providing one compact context object for an explicitly identified Environment.

**Scope:** stable Environment/Workspace identity, Environment root, bounded tree digest, enabled MCPs and passive observed tool-name summary, enabled Skills and support summary, verifier availability, run/verifier usage guidance and unavailable capability reasons. Static MCP server instructions advertise how to obtain the bundle; dynamic data still requires explicit `environment_id`.

**Non-goals:** hidden current-Environment session state, prompt/task orchestration, choosing the task plan, auto-calling/probing MCP tools, silently injecting Memory values or full Skill instructions, interpreting Skills into ADM workflows.

**Completion direction:** an Agent can start work with one concise explicit ADM context instead of manually probing many surfaces, while preserving existing authority and privacy boundaries.

**Completion:** Phase 20 is complete. `.planning/phases/20-agent-context-bundle/20-CLOSEOUT.md`, `20-01-SUMMARY.md` and `20-02-SUMMARY.md` record bounded Core composition, passive Gateway-owner enrichment, the shared Agent/Admin context tool, static initialize guidance, full Go/vet evidence and the fixed-head artifact. Phase 21 is also complete as recorded below.

## Phase 21 — Async Verifier + Long Operation Observability

**Goal:** Make heavy verification flows observable and resilient across client/tool timeouts.

**Scope:** distinct owner-local `vfrun_` start/list/status/cancel lifecycle for configured verifier definitions, bounded live output, terminal `verifier.Result` retention, writer heartbeat/cancellation, owner/Environment cleanup, no restart persistence, and clearer blocking-request interruption diagnostics. Existing Phase-20 context guidance may point Agents toward async verification for long work without starting anything.

**Non-goals:** replacing/aliasing generic `run_`, persisted verifier history/resume, CI orchestration, automatic retry/replay, arbitrary duration cutoffs for synchronous verifier calls, Desktop/CLI feature expansion or task/GSD semantics.

**Completion direction:** long tests/builds/verifiers can be monitored across client disconnects without losing owner-local output/results to an outer tool timeout, while short synchronous verifier calls and all existing authority boundaries remain intact.

**Completion:** Phases 21 and 22 are complete. Phase 21 evidence remains in `.planning/phases/21-async-verifier-observability/`; Phase 22 evidence is recorded in `.planning/phases/22-temporary-task-environments/22-01-SUMMARY.md`, `22-02-SUMMARY.md`, `22-03-SUMMARY.md`, and `22-CLOSEOUT.md`, with final implementation head `56c79e3`.

## Phase 22 — Temporary Task Environments + Safe Cleanup Workflow

**Goal:** Let Agents create task-scoped work areas without polluting durable project state.

**Status:** COMPLETE — Core lifecycle, shared Agent/Admin workflow, Desktop visibility/actions and fixed-head integrated acceptance are delivered through `56c79e3`.

**Scope:** atomic temporary Environment creation with explicit lifecycle owner + positive TTL; optional session/run provenance; existing Workspace-contained root or optional ADM-managed worktree mode; Environment-targeted cleanup preview/execute; matching-owner promote-to-durable; active writer/MCP/process/`run_`/`vfrun_` blockers; existing managed-worktree dirty/unpublished/tamper safety; bounded Desktop visibility/actions through Admin MCP.

**Non-goals:** ADM task records/orchestration, automatic GC, unsafe deletion of ordinary host/project directories, force cleanup, automatic merge/rebase/push, branch deletion, new CLI lifecycle UX, or deleting ambiguous non-ADM roots.

**Completion direction:** temporary work can be safely created, inspected, promoted or cleaned up with conservative current evidence while ordinary non-Git Environment development stays valid and unrelated temporary resources are never swept by a targeted cleanup.

**Detailed planning:** `.planning/phases/22-temporary-task-environments/22-CONTEXT.md`, `22-01-PLAN.md`, `22-02-PLAN.md`, `22-03-PLAN.md`. All three plans are complete. Core feature commit is `0f6efa7`, Gateway feature commit is `d51a426`, and final Desktop/fixed-head implementation is `56c79e3`. See `22-01-SUMMARY.md`, `22-02-SUMMARY.md`, `22-03-SUMMARY.md`, and `22-CLOSEOUT.md`. `ADM-CORE-022` is the product contract.

## Phase 23 — CLI Agent UX + MCP/Skill Provisioning

**Goal:** Make CLI setup and automation smoother for humans and Agents.

**Status:** COMPLETE — MCP/Skill provisioning, Environment context/temporary lifecycle CLI and fixed-head integrated acceptance are delivered through `f85c566`.

**Scope:** keep normal CLI management on Admin MCP while adding MCP import-from-file/stdin, distinct global probe / Environment status / passive owner-runtime inspect / explicit refresh flows, Skill source update with multiple support roots plus global/Environment availability diagnostics, the existing Phase-20 Environment context bundle, and the existing Phase-22 temporary Environment lifecycle.

**Non-goals:** a second Admin API, direct normal-mode writable state access, hidden current Workspace/Environment, cwd-based authorization, a universal CLI formatter/query layer, new MCP/Skill/Core semantics, force temporary cleanup, task/GSD orchestration, Desktop feature work, or the Phase-24 package split.

**Completion direction:** common MCP/Skill/Environment setup tasks are easy from CLI, use explicit stable IDs, preserve the shared authority/safety contracts, and produce machine-readable existing-model output without introducing a second surface model.

**Detailed planning:** `.planning/phases/23-cli-agent-ux/23-CONTEXT.md`, `23-01-PLAN.md` and `23-02-PLAN.md`. Both plans are complete: 23-01 at `b733948`, final implementation head `f85c566`. See `23-01-SUMMARY.md`, `23-02-SUMMARY.md`, and `23-CLOSEOUT.md`. `ADM-CLI-001` is the Phase-23 product contract.

## Phase 24 — Desktop/CLI Surface Boundary Split

**Goal:** Keep Desktop and CLI independently optimizable without forking product semantics.

**Scope:** package/module cleanup, shared management adapter boundaries, release/build naming clarity, surface-specific tests, frontend/backend separation inside the existing repository.

**Non-goals:** immediate multi-repo split, second state file, duplicate business logic.

**Completion direction:** Desktop and CLI can evolve separately while still sharing one Core contract.

## Phase 25 — Distribution Polish If Needed

**Goal:** Add distribution features only when daily use proves they matter.

**Scope candidates:** installer, updater, signing, notifications, deeper autostart polish, release UX.

**Non-goals:** speculative packaging work before a real blocker.

**Completion direction:** open only with concrete post-1.0 dogfood evidence.

## Phase 26 — Evidence-first Investigation Expansion

**Goal:** Add deeper investigation helpers only when real development tasks show generic file/search/runtime tools are insufficient.

**Scope candidates:** symbol/reference/write tracing, impact evidence, data lineage, debug-SQL-to-code mapping, test metric explanation, symbol-scoped history.

**Non-goals:** mandatory code graph engine, speculative provider lock-in, ADM task planning.

**Completion direction:** each slice must return evidence, confidence and uncertainty, with fallback behavior when optional providers are unavailable.

## Review notes — 2026-09-11

The sequence is retained after source/contract review. Phase 19's bounded tree digest informs 20. Async verifier (21) has no hard dependency on 19/20 and may be explicitly reprioritized if the existing pjadm timeout blocker recurs. Phase 22 reuses the completed Phase 15 lifecycle/cleanup primitives; task-scoped UX must not create ADM task orchestration. Local frontend extraction required by 18 does not wait for the wider Desktop/CLI boundary cleanup in 24. Phases 25/26 remain conditional.

## Immediate next phase

Phases 18-23 are complete. Phase 23 closed through final implementation head `f85c566`; `23-01-SUMMARY.md`, `23-02-SUMMARY.md`, and `23-CLOSEOUT.md` record the evidence. Phase 24 remains planned/not started and must not begin automatically.


## Dogfood checkpoint — 2026-09-12

After Phase 18 closeout and before Phase 19 execution, Desktop received a bounded dogfood fix: visual status/card polish plus exec_denials observations for Runtime allowlist rejections. The denial log records executable/count/source metadata only, not command args or output. Phase 19 remains planned and unstarted.
