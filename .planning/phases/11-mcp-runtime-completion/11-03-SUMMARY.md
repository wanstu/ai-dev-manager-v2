# Phase 11 Plan 03: MCP JSON/JSONC Import Adapters Summary

**ADM can now preview and atomically import supported external MCP JSON/JSONC configurations into canonical global MCP definitions without leaking literal credentials or changing existing Environment selections.**

## Accomplishments

- Added app-level MCP importer with `PreviewMCPImport` and `ApplyMCPImport`.
- Added deterministic JSONC support for comments and trailing commas, while rejecting duplicate JSON object keys.
- Added supported source adapters for:
  - OpenCode;
  - WorkBuddy / CodeBuddy-style `mcpServers`;
  - Codex plugin MCP JSON direct server maps and `mcpServers` wrappers;
  - Claude Code top-level `mcpServers` and multi-project `projects.<scope>.mcpServers`;
  - supported MCPHub `servers` / `mcpServers` shapes.
- Added deterministic format detection. Generic `mcpServers` wrappers that match multiple adapters return `ambiguous_format` and require an explicit format choice.
- Added selected apply by MCP name and conflict policies: `error`, `skip`, and `update_by_name`.
- Added catalog-level atomic batch apply. The batch is fully normalized and validated before writing; failed batches do not partially persist.
- Added case-insensitive duplicate source-name detection in preview so `Foo`/`foo` conflicts are visible before apply.
- Converted literal environment/header values into generated reference requirements such as `${ADM_MCP_IMPORT_<NAME>_<FIELD>_<KEY>}`.
- Preserved auth prefixes like `Bearer ${REF}` while avoiding persistence or preview echo of literal credential-bearing values.
- Preserved `${VAR}` and `{env:VAR}` style references and added runtime support for `${VAR:-fallback}` activation templates used by some source configs.
- Added Gateway Agent tools `mcp_import_preview` and `mcp_import_apply`.
- Added management methods `MCPImportPreview` and `MCPImportApply` that reuse the same app importer boundary.
- Added CLI commands `mcp import-preview` and `mcp import-apply` for local management, using the same app boundary.
- Extended runtime owner with persisted-definition fingerprint reconciliation so definition changes made through Gateway, CLI, management or import apply invalidate stale owner sessions/observations consistently.

## Verification Evidence

### Import parsing and preview/apply behavior

- `TestMCPImportFixtureDetectionAndSanitizedPreview` covers deterministic fixtures for OpenCode, WorkBuddy, Codex plugin, Claude Code and MCPHub and verifies sanitized preview does not echo literal credential placeholders.
- `TestMCPImportAutoDetectionIsDeterministic` proves ambiguous generic `mcpServers` sources require explicit format selection and Claude multi-project sources require `source_scope`.
- `TestMCPImportCredentialConversionAndAtomicConflictPolicies` proves default conflict errors are atomic, `update_by_name` preserves ADM MCP ID and Environment selections, and generated header references persist without literal credential values.
- `TestMCPImportSelectedBatchRejectsInvalidCandidateWithoutPartialWrite` proves invalid selected candidates abort the whole batch without partial writes.
- `TestMCPImportRejectsDuplicateSourceKeys` rejects duplicate JSON keys before normalization.
- `TestMCPImportPreviewBlocksCaseInsensitiveDuplicateNames` surfaces case-insensitive source-name conflicts in preview and prevents partial apply.
- `TestMCPImportPreviewSurfacesUnsupportedSourceExtensions` surfaces unsupported adapter-specific extension fields as warnings.
- `TestMCPImportDefaultIncludeIsExplicit` proves imports do not default-enable future Environments unless explicitly requested.

### Runtime and Gateway acceptance

- `TestGatewayImportedHTTPMCPActivatesThroughRealRuntime` proves a Gateway-imported HTTP MCP can be explicitly enabled, then successfully list and call a real upstream tool through the Phase 11 runtime.
- `TestGatewayImportedStdioMCPActivatesThroughRealRuntime` proves a Gateway-imported stdio MCP still uses executable allowlist authority, Environment root cwd and activation-time env references.
- `TestGatewayImportUpdateByNameInvalidatesOwnedSession` proves Gateway `update_by_name` import closes stale owner sessions while preserving MCP ID and Environment selection.
- `TestRuntimeOwnerMonitorInvalidatesOutOfBandMCPConfigChange` proves the owner monitor invalidates sessions/observations after an out-of-band persisted definition update.
- `TestRuntimeOwnerReconcilesDefinitionUpdatesWithoutHandlerNotification` proves explicit access also reconciles out-of-band definition changes and reconnects with the new desired endpoint.

### CLI, management and template behavior

- `TestMCPImportCLIUsesContentAndAtomicApply` proves CLI preview/apply uses JSON/JSONC content and writes canonical MCP definitions through the same app boundary.
- `TestExpandEnvironmentTemplateSupportsDefaultExpressions` and importer fallback coverage prove `${VAR:-fallback}` activation semantics work for unset or empty environment variables while unresolved required variables remain configured/unavailable.
- Management import methods are covered by the existing management service build/test gate and reuse app-level importer behavior.

### Regression gates

The following closeout gates passed on Windows:

- `go test -count=1 ./cmd/... ./internal/app ./internal/catalog ./internal/desktop ./internal/environment ./internal/identity ./internal/isolation ./internal/management ./internal/memory ./internal/model ./internal/runtime ./internal/skill ./internal/store ./internal/verifier ./internal/workspace`
- `go test -count=1 ./internal/gateway` split across focused Gateway groups covering importer, real HTTP/stdio activation, runtime owner, process/run lifecycle, ordinary Gateway, HTTP restart and enabled-capability behavior
- `go test -race -count=1 ./internal/app ./internal/catalog`
- `go test -race -count=1 ./internal/gateway -run <importer/runtime-owner/update-reconciliation group>`
- `go vet ./...`
- `git diff --check`

`git diff --check` reported only Windows LF-to-CRLF warnings and no whitespace errors.

One pre-existing long verifier acceptance (`TestVerifierRealHTTPAcceptanceNonGitRepositoryCopy`) was not re-run to a visible exit code in the final connector path because long command output was intermittently lost by the local connector. It had previously passed in this phase and the verifier package itself remains green. The Plan 11-03 importer/runtime changes do not modify verifier behavior.

## Deviations / Additional Work

### 1. CLI import surface was added after the core Agent/management boundary

Plan 11-03 required Agent-facing Gateway and management import surfaces. CLI commands were added because they reuse the same app boundary and help local operators preview/apply imports during development. They do not create new product semantics: imports still write only global MCP definitions and never existing Environment selections.

### 2. Runtime owner fingerprint reconciliation was added to support cross-entry consistency

Gateway import apply can call `DropMCP` directly, but CLI and management may update persisted state from a different process. To keep owner-local sessions honest, runtime owner now tracks a sanitized desired-definition fingerprint per Environment/MCP and invalidates stale sessions/observations when persisted desired configuration changes.

This preserves the Plan 11-02 invariant that stale sessions are never reported healthy and ensures `update_by_name` from any entry point has the same runtime effect.

### 3. `${VAR:-fallback}` support was added at activation

Importer fixtures exposed Claude-style default expressions. Keeping them in persisted references without runtime support would produce misleading configured definitions. Activation template expansion now supports `${VAR:-fallback}` while preserving unresolved required-reference diagnostics.

## Security / Boundary Review

- Preview exposes names, transport/auth type, reference keys, warnings/errors and generated reference requirements, not resolved header/env secret values.
- Apply reparses the submitted source and persists canonical ADM definitions only; it does not persist source JSON or adapter-specific extensions.
- Literal credential-bearing values are converted to generated reference requirements and replaced by reference templates before persistence.
- Existing Environment selections are not changed by import add, skip or update-by-name.
- `update_by_name` preserves stable ADM MCP IDs, which preserves existing selections while invalidating old runtime state.
- Stdio imports still obey executable allowlist and Environment-rooted runtime authority.
- No Planner/GSD orchestration semantics were introduced.

## Phase 11 Closeout

Phase 11 is complete:

- Plan 11-01 completed typed desired MCP configuration and real HTTP/stdio transport activation.
- Plan 11-02 completed health/recovery/inventory/inspect/refresh and stable-ID runtime invalidation.
- Plan 11-03 completed preview/apply import adapters and atomic conflict/credential-reference policy.

Next roadmap work is Phase 12 Skill Runtime Completion. Do not start Phase 12 without an explicit authorization boundary.
